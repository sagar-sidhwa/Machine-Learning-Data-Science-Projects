    "\n",
    "This project successfully demonstrates the implementation of a domain-specific **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline** for DevOps knowledge retrieval. By combining a lightweight **LLM (`google/flan-t5-small`)** with a **FAISS vector database**, we've created an efficient and highly-relevant question-answering system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key achievements of this project include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Effective Knowledge Retrieval**: The pipeline effectively retrieves relevant information from the curated dataset, addressing the challenges of providing accurate and context-aware answers.\n",
    "* **Performance with Lightweight Models**: We've shown that high performance can be achieved without relying on a large, resource-intensive LLM, making the solution more accessible and cost-effective.\n",
    "* **End-to-End Workflow**: This notebook provides a complete and reproducible workflow, from data preparation and vectorization to the final RAG query and response.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Expanding the Dataset**: Integrate a wider range of documentation and knowledge sources to expand the system's expertise.\n",
    "* **Advanced Evaluation**: Implement more rigorous evaluation metrics to benchmark the model's accuracy and relevance against other RAG systems.\n",
    "* **Deployment**: Package the pipeline into a simple API for easy integration into web applications or chatbots."
