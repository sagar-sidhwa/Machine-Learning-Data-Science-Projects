# 🛣️ Pavement Condition Monitoring & Maintenance Prediction

## 📌 Objective
Predict whether a road segment requires maintenance based on pavement condition and traffic/weather history.

## 📊 Dataset Features
- PCI (Pavement Condition Index)
- AADT (Annual Average Daily Traffic)
- Last Maintenance Year
- Rainfall, IRI, Rutting
- Target: Maintenance Needed (Yes/No)

## 🔍 Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- SVM
- XGBoost
- LightGBM

## ✅ Accuracy Summary
| Model | Accuracy |
|-------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 99.99% |
| Random Forest | 99.99% |
| XGBoost | 99.99% |

## ⚠️ Note
High accuracy is due to dataset structure — avoid overfitting by aggressive hyperparameter tuning.
